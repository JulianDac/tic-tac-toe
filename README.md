# React + Vite

Just a standard tic-tac-toe game on a 3x3 board using React + Vite. This is my revision on some React concepts including props, useEffect, useState. 
Features:
- Two people can take turn to play
- Display who wins at the end / display if it's a draw
- A restart button to restart the game at any time
- After the game ends, a countdown of 10s will start to reset the board

Future enhancement:
- Capture snapshots of the game and implement a rewind feature
